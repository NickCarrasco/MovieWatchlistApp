## Project Requirements

- Two pages - index.html and watchlist.html
- Index = search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results
- Button to "add to watchlist" which saves the data to local storage
- Watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage.

## Experience Gained

- Developed a movie search and watchlist web application using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Integrated OMDb API to fetch movie data including titles, posters, release years, and IMDb ratings
- Implemented real-time search functionality with asynchronous API calls (`fetch, async/await`)
- Enabled users to add movies to a personal watchlist with a single click
- Created a separate watchlist page that retrieves and displays saved movies from `localStorage`
- Used `localStorage` to persist the watchlist across sessions without requiring backend support
- Added functionality to remove movies from the watchlist, updating both the UI and stored data
- Applied dynamic DOM manipulation to render movie cards and update the interface in real-time
- Structured code for modularity and readability, using semantic HTML5 and organized JS functions
- Gained hands-on experience with REST APIs, client-side storage, and building interactive UIs without frameworks
